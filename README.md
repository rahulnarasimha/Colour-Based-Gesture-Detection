# Colour-Based-Gesture-Detection
A colour based american hand gesture detection system using processing IDE for assistance of the deaf and dumb

To Design a system that can read human hand gestures of sign language and differentiate between them using image processing via processing IDE and convert them into alphabets on a LED Matrix using an Arduino with a Bluetooth module with the help of serial communication from the processing IDE.

The input signal in image form is generated by the camera, which is then passed on to the processing ide which processes the image to get the required signal i.e. The gesture showed by the hand by comparing the input and the guideline image pixels, based on this gesture the output of the IDE is given as input to the Arduino which is coded to give corresponding alphabet output for the corresponding input gesture.

Detailed Methodology:

Each pixel on the screen is analysed for their colour in terms of R,G,B values .These values are compared with an existing standard developed for each finger. The technique is used to identify and draw an outline around the pixels which are in range of the desired colour.
The output alphbets is displayed on a LED matrix in a scrolling fasion.
